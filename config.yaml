    subtitle: Monday, 23rd of March
    text: |
        DataEngConfAU is currently scheduled for the 3rd-4th of August, 2020.

        The organising committee for DataEngConfAU is actively and continuously monitoring the COVID-19 virus outbreak in line with Australian Government public health advice and the World Health Organization (WHO).

        As of March 23, the conference is still over four months away. However, the situation is very fluid and changing daily. The Australian Government has advised that non-essential outside gatherings should be limited to 500 people and indoor gatherings of 100 people.

        While there is still time, we are adopting a cautious approach before we postpone the event. The safety of all participants, from sponsors to speakers to attendees to volunteers, is our priority.

        We are going to make a final decision on the event proceeding on June 4, 2020.

        In the meantime we are pausing ticket sales and sponsorship activity. Tickets that have already been purchased will be proactively refunded. Our sponsors are aware of our current position, and we thank them for their continued support of our conference and community events.

        We will continue to monitor the situation. You can read the latest on our website or twitter at any time. Please contact us via the website should you have any concerns.

        The Australian Department of Health recommends that everyone should practise good hygiene to protect against infections.

    title: What's DataEngConfAU All About?

    text: "Data Engineering is a buzzword that has vegemite appeal. For some, it points to the future of how businesses do data in a post-cloud world, and for others, they struggle to understand where it fits in a world full of data science / ML and AI buzzwords. \n DataEngConfAU is a single track, one-day event that moves away from the hype and focuses on the reality data engineering based solutions. It’s about fostering a community locally and helping all of us learn from each other as we embrace a new way of building applications. \n DataEngConfAU is the evolution of the hugely popular Sydney Data Engineering meetup, and we are building on the success of it since its 2017 commencement. We are holding the day in a to be determined venue at Sydney’s CBD on 4th August 2019. \n As a community event, we aim to keep conference fees to a minimum - we don’t want to put a huge financial barrier between attendees and a great event. Sponsorship also allows us to offer a small number of free invitations to disadvantaged or underrepresented community members. "
