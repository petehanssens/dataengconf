      "title": "Bringing Software Engineering Rigour to Data",
      "description": "As a consultant with a software background, I get to see a lot of gaps in the data engineering world. The gap of maturity between the data and software communities in engineering rigour is the most prominent one.  \r\n\r\nIn software engineering, we have learnt that building robust and stable applications has a direct correlation with overall organisation performance as outlined in the industry leading Accelerate State of DevOps research by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA). This is achieved through practices like infrastructure-as-code for deployments, automated testing, application observability, and end-to-end application lifecycle ownership. \r\n\r\nAlthough the data community is scratching the surfaces of possibility and striving to incorporate the core concepts, it is far from reaching its full potential.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will go through ways to leverage software engineering good practices into data engineering and demonstrate how measuring key performance metrics could help build more robust and reliable data pipelines.",

      "title": "Data Poker not Data Chess - thinking in Bets for Data Teams",
      "description": "Data science and machine learning are deep into their business hype cycle - in 2023, every CEO wants to be “data-driven” in their strategy. As data practitioners, we are regularly relied upon to contribute to key strategic decisions:\r\n\r\n- Will this dataset support an ML use-case we think our customers want?\r\n- Do we need a streaming architecture? \r\n- Should we self-host Spark, or go with a vendor-managed service?\r\n- Is it worth uplifting our simple ML model to use a shiny deep learning technique?\r\n- When should we embed our data analysts and scientists in cross functional teams vs locating them in an enabling team that provides org-wide support?\r\n- Are there even times it just isn’t appropriate to apply data science thinking?\r\n\r\nGet enough of these decisions right, and you will be on the road to enabling your teams to build high-performing data products, and share valuable insights across your organisation. Get them wrong, and you will start to see a pattern of data-dependent projects under-delivering, gain a reputation for spending like drunken (data) sailors, experience runaway total cost-of-ownership, and face ongoing challenges unlocking the value of your organisation’s data. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will attempt to persuade you that all strategic decisions (including those made by data practitioners) should be thought of as bets, and that decision quality should not be evaluated by outcomes alone, as outcomes of past decisions are determined by a combination of skill & luck. \r\n\r\nWe need to cultivate the ability to differentiate between skill and luck, so that we can make appropriately sized bets that are proportionate with our degree of uncertainty, and so we can push the right feedback from decision outcomes into our learning loops.\r\n\r\nThe DIBBs Framework, popularised by Spotify (based on work by Annie Duke) is a structured process for decomposing strategic decisions into Data, Insight, then Belief, to support appropriately sized Bets. This talk will take you through the framework, and show you ways in which you can use it to make better decisions both within your data teams and at the broader data strategy level of your organisation. A structured approach like DIBBs, acknowledging luck and uncertainty, will likely improve progress towards an organisational North Star over time.",

      "description": "Data Governance is an emerging trend in enterprise information management. This is mainly because organizations are becoming increasingly serious about the notion of \"data as a strategic asset\" as they face increasing pressure for reporting a \"single source of the truth.\" \r\n\r\nAlso, pursuant to legislative compliance mandates such as the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and Basel II, Data Governance has recently gained significant prominence in practitioners' conferences, such as TDWI (The Data Warehousing Institute) World Conference and DAMA (Data Management Association) International Symposium. Research has evidenced the need for Data Governance in organisations to manage data effectively. It is only by effective data management that organisations can ensure good quality data which can be measured by its accuracy, timeliness, relevance, completeness, trustworthiness and contextual definition. \r\n\r\nHowever, studies have also revealed that large organisation that\r\nhas adopted an ad-hoc Data Governance model to manage its data found that its data management efforts were hampered by the lack of clear roles and responsibilities and the lack of mandate to carry out data quality improvement initiatives. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this paper is to provide an overall framework for data governance that can be used by organisations to develop an effective data governance approach, strategy and design. \r\n",

      "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires large amounts of labelled training data for models to be accurately trained. In semantic segmentation, each pixel is assigned a value based on which class or classes it belongs to. On the other hand, an ontology is a collection of classes, their properties and the relationships between them. Semantic segmentation, then, lends itself quite naturally to integration with an ontology, where insights from the direct and indirect relationships between classes can be used to enhance the training data.\r\n\r\nRecently, Nearmap has introduced an ontology system, which integrates directly into our labelling software, linking labelled data directly to the definitions in the ontology. Preliminary work on the system has already helped identify conflicts between labels in the production dataset.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, a number of challenges unique to managing Nearmap’s large geospatial dataset had to be overcome. We present our solution which handles reproducibility, version tracking, multiple perspectives in the source imagery and the storage of image examples as part of the class definitions.",

      "description": "Is building trust a technical problem? How will an organisation know when data is trusted? Who is the arbiter of trust, and how do they communicate their confidence in the data? These are some of the many questions that inevitably arise when organisations move from data strategies to data operations. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most organisations are simply not in a position to know that the market has consistently overcomplicated the technical delivery of data solutions whilst simultaneously underserving the complex and ever-evolving needs of business teams. This dichotomy effectively undermines organisational trust in data and dooms the vast majority of data initiatives to failure.  By contrast, an organisation that starts small and moves quickly, matches investment and technology to value delivered, and continuously improves upon its capabilities builds confidence in data and accelerates the time-to-value of data solutions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk a rigorous, engineering-led methodology for building trust in data will be presented. Key components of a continuous improvement framework for data solutions will be shared and tools for implementing them will be discussed. These frameworks and methodologies leverage lessons gathered over the course of 15 years of delivering data solutions in Australia and will be supported by three real-world case studies that have delivered billions of dollars in combined value back to their organisations.",

We will describe the constraints of each of the patterns, break them down into their core components and describe how to apply them to real world problems. We will share principles you can apply when choosing data infrastructure and detail what to consider when solving for idempotency.\r\n",

      "description": "It is no secret that data driven decision making can significantly increase the effectiveness of charities. However, the non-profit sector is often left behind in the pursuit of data insights due to lack of resources, time and know-how. This session will explore some of the unique challenges that non-profits face when establishing a data capability, and how simple solutions can create impact and drive social good.",

The talk is broken down into the following stages:\r\n- Combining 2 open source spam datasets curated by The University of California, Irvine (UCI).\r\n- Preparing a new dataset to be fully ready for training a model. \r\n- Building and training an LSTM model leveraging Keras.\r\n- Creating an API to expose the model for use leveraging FastAPI\r\n- Storing inference data for improving future predictions\r\n",
