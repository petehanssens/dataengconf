In fact, it sometimes just feels like magic. This ‚Äòmagic‚Äô behind it is often powered by ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù. But even ‚ÄúAI‚Äù has its limitations.\r\nI‚Äôll show examples where ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and ML have failed (sometimes with horrible consequences) and will explain why failures are unavosidable in ML but also mention what we can do to reduce them in the future.\r\nFurthermore, I‚Äôll showcase how current AI implementations discriminate against minorities and how that in some cases even leads to a higher risk of death for those groups.\r\nI‚Äôll cover the bias that humans introduce and I‚Äôll explain how poor choice of data makes our world even more unjust than it already is.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway for the audience: AI can fail and sometimes it has horrible consequences.

Additionally, to automatically trigger our pipeline we used Airflow that produced its own series of advantages and challenges. \r\nWe believe the issues we encountered during the process represent valuables lessons. In this talk, we'll share these lessons with you, to help you in your journey towards automating ML pipelines.  \r\nTopics include:\r\n* Autoscaling in Kubernetes\r\n* Visibility and logging stacks in Kubernetes\r\n* ML pipelines scheduling with Airflow ",

Within the data, you‚Äôve got some bits you‚Äôre interested in, and of those bits, you‚Äôd like to be able to query information about them at any point. Sounds fun, right? Since I mentioned ‚Äúquerying,‚Äù I‚Äôd hazard a guess that you‚Äôve got in mind an additional datastore of some sort, whether relational or NoSQL.\r\n\r\nBut what if I told you...that you dsidn‚Äôt need any datastore other than Kafka itself? What if you could ingest, filter, enrich, aggregate, and query data with just Kafka? With ksqlDB we can do just this, and I want to show you exactly how.\r\n\r\nIn this hands-on talk we'll walk through an example of building a Telegram bot in which ksqlDB provsides the key/value lookups driven by a materialised view on the stream of events in Kafka. We'll take a look at what ksqlDB is and its capabilities for processing data and driving applications, as well as integrating with other systems. ",
