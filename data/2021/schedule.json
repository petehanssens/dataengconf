            "description": "Data has the ability to transform and automate business processes. But data also comes with a responsibility to keep people’s personal information protected and ensure it is used in an ethical manner. It is the responsibility of data engineers to instinctively identify and separate dangerous data from the benign.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Stephen Bailey PhD, director of data and analytics for Immuta, will discuss the need for data engineers to take on the responsibility of data privacy. While all organizations working with data understand the seriousness of data privacy, many aren’t sure who is responsible for protecting it. Stephen will explain why managing privacy loss is something only data engineers can solve, as data engineers are the ones who created the systems. \r\n\r\nHe will outline a suggested new set of engineering best practices that go beyond the domains of security and system design. These best practices will include understanding the strengths and weaknesses of data masking, learning anonymization techniques like k-anonymization and differential privacy,. Ultimately, data engineers should know the practice of privacy by design as intuitively as they do the principle of least privilege. \r\n\r\nAttendees of this educational session will walk away with a better understanding of how they can improve data privacy without compromising data access control. Threats to data aren’t slowing down, so it’s time to fight against them. \r\n",

            "description": "Machine learning has a wider and wider adoption in the industry as a technology to build intelligent and data enriched systems. However, the reality is that machine learning practice often stops at the end of rapid experiments before its value can be harvested in the real world. This is because the process and the culture of taking ML models from experiment to production is lacking.\r\n\r\nA machine learning project typically consists of experiment, development and deployment three main phrases. Correspondingly, a machine learning system consists of processes and components that facilitate the operations and data flows in those three main phrases. This system provides a framework and best practices for machine learning practitioners to develop models from experiment to production.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores the process pattern of getting a machine learning model into production and the system to support this operation. An example of productionising a natural language processing model will be used to illustrate how a model travels through experiment tracking, data artifacts management, data / machine learning pipelines and goes into production. The talk will also provide examples of tooling and patterns to be used at each stage.\r\n",

            "description": "The gravitational pull of cloud data warehouses is a powerful force on data platform architecture. This is evidenced by the growing use of data warehouses to build and serve data products and the well-established shift from ETL to ELT transformation patterns. More recently the trend of pushing data transformations to inside the data warehouse is playing out on the consumption side, with business metric definition and calculation being shifted from fragmented locations across multiple BI tools and data science notebooks into the data warehouse, where they can be published for use across the organisation by a range of consumers.   \r\n\r\nThis trend has recently coalesced around the notion of a metrics layer within the modern data stack. In this talk I will unpack the challenges motivating this change in data architecture and identify the core features of the metrics layer that meets these needs. I will look at different flavours of data architecture that enable these features by surveying existing OSS tools and vendor offerings. In doing so, I will address the questions of how this notion of a metrics layer differs from existing approaches to OLAP databases, and whether data warehouses are the appropriate place to be building metric layers.

            "description": "In file systems, large sequential writes are more beneficial than small random writes, and hence many storage systems implement a log structured file system. In the same way, the cloud favors large objects more than small objects. Cloud providers place throttling limits on PUTs and GETs, and so it takes significantly longer time to upload a bunch of small objects than a large object of the aggregate size. Moreover, there are per-PUT calls associated with uploading smaller objects.\r\nIn Netflix, a lot of media assets and their relevant metadata is generated and pushed to cloud. Most of these files are between 10s of bytes to 10s of kilobytes and are saved as small objects on Cloud.\r\nIn this talk, we would like to propose a strategy to compact these small objects into larger blobs before uploading them to Cloud. We will discuss the policies to select relevant smaller objects, and how to manage the indexing of these objects within the blob. We will also discuss how different cloud storage operations such as reads and deletes would be implemented for such objects. This includes recycling blobs that have dead small objects - due to overwrites, etc.\r\nFinally, we would showcase the potential impact of such a strategy on Netflix assets in terms of cost and performance.\r\n",

While working  with one of our clients (who happens to be a fan of AWS and Snowflake) we came up with a revolutionary way to set up snowpipe integration for any project using just 10 to 15 lines of Yaml file. Yes, you heard me correctly a yaml to deploy snowpipe not SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract(Long Description)...\r\nLeverage Snowpipe’s continuous integration property.. \r\nIn this presentation I’ll share techniques to overcome:-\r\nYou are running SQL every time you run a pipeline, hence unnecessary SQL execution.\r\nHard to maintain SQL queries if a project doesn't have any SQL platform.\r\nThis was very specific for this project, with every new changes/branch we end up in creating a number of artifacts and when we merge the changes to master we literally destroy everything and recreate the same stuff again which ends up causing downtime for customer heavy projects.\r\nEveryone likes less bits of code whether it's SQL, code etc.\r\nWhat problems does it solved:-\r\nBeautiful is better than ugly. YAML really looks more niche than SQL.\r\nFlags used saved us lot of time and execution if already pipe exits when it Create or if Update only run necessary SQL and Delete for housekeeping \r\nThe happiest of them all where the people whole were devops, they love yaml more than anything.\r\nNo outage if no changes made to the snowpipe artifacts.\r\n",

But data also comes with a responsibility to keep people’s personal information protected and ensure it is used in an ethical manner. It is the responsibility of data engineers to instinctively identify and separate dangerous data from the benign.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Stephen Bailey PhD, director of data and analytics for Immuta, will discuss the need for data engineers to take on the responsibility of data privacy. While all organizations working with data understand the seriousness of data privacy, many aren’t sure who is responsible for protecting it. Stephen will explain why managing privacy loss is something only data engineers can solve, as data engineers are the ones who created the systems. \r\n\r\nHe will outline a suggested new set of engineering best practices that go beyond the domains of security and system design. These best practices will include understanding the strengths and weaknesses of data masking, learning anonymization techniques like k-anonymization and differential privacy,. Ultimately, data engineers should know the practice of privacy by design as intuitively as they do the principle of least privilege. \r\n\r\nAttendees of this educational session will walk away with a better understanding of how they can improve data privacy without compromising data access control. Threats to data aren’t slowing down, so it’s time to fight against them. \r\n",

              "description": "The gravitational pull of cloud data warehouses is a powerful force on data platform architecture. This is evidenced by the growing use of data warehouses to build and serve data products and the well-established shift from ETL to ELT transformation patterns. More recently the trend of pushing data transformations to inside the data warehouse is playing out on the consumption side, with business metric definition and calculation being shifted from fragmented locations across multiple BI tools and data science notebooks into the data warehouse, where they can be published for use across the organisation by a range of consumers.   \r\n\r\nThis trend has recently coalesced around the notion of a metrics layer within the modern data stack. In this talk I will unpack the challenges motivating this change in data architecture and identify the core features of the metrics layer that meets these needs. I will look at different flavours of data architecture that enable these features by surveying existing OSS tools and vendor offerings. In doing so, I will address the questions of how this notion of a metrics layer differs from existing approaches to OLAP databases, and whether data warehouses are the appropriate place to be building metric layers.

              "description": "Machine learning has a wider and wider adoption in the industry as a technology to build intelligent and data enriched systems. However, the reality is that machine learning practice often stops at the end of rapid experiments before its value can be harvested in the real world. This is because the process and the culture of taking ML models from experiment to production is lacking.\r\n\r\nA machine learning project typically consists of experiment, development and deployment three main phrases. Correspondingly, a machine learning system consists of processes and components that facilitate the operations and data flows in those three main phrases. This system provides a framework and best practices for machine learning practitioners to develop models from experiment to production.\r\n\r\nThis talk explores the process pattern of getting a machine learning model into production and the system to support this operation. An example of productionising a natural language processing model will be used to illustrate how a model travels through experiment tracking, data artifacts management, data / machine learning pipelines and goes into production. The talk will also provide examples of tooling and patterns to be used at each stage.\r\n",

              "description": "In file systems, large sequential writes are more beneficial than small random writes, and hence many storage systems implement a log structured file system. In the same way, the cloud favors large objects more than small objects. Cloud providers place throttling limits on PUTs and GETs, and so it takes significantly longer time to upload a bunch of small objects than a large object of the aggregate size. Moreover, there are per-PUT calls associated with uploading smaller objects.\r\nIn Netflix, a lot of media assets and their relevant metadata is generated and pushed to cloud. Most of these files are between 10s of bytes to 10s of kilobytes and are saved as small objects on Cloud.\r\nIn this talk, we would like to propose a strategy to compact these small objects into larger blobs before uploading them to Cloud. We will discuss the policies to select relevant smaller objects, and how to manage the indexing of these objects within the blob. We will also discuss how different cloud storage operations such as reads and deletes would be implemented for such objects. This includes recycling blobs that have dead small objects - due to overwrites, etc.\r\nFinally, we would showcase the potential impact of such a strategy on Netflix assets in terms of cost and performance.\r\n",

While working  with one of our clients (who happens to be a fan of AWS and Snowflake) we came up with a revolutionary way to set up snowpipe integration for any project using just 10 to 15 lines of Yaml file. Yes, you heard me correctly a yaml to deploy snowpipe not SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbstract(Long Description)...\r\nLeverage Snowpipe’s continuous integration property.. \r\nIn this presentation I’ll share techniques to overcome:-\r\nYou are running SQL every time you run a pipeline, hence unnecessary SQL execution.\r\nHard to maintain SQL queries if a project doesn't have any SQL platform.\r\nThis was very specific for this project, with every new changes/branch we end up in creating a number of artifacts and when we merge the changes to master we literally destroy everything and recreate the same stuff again which ends up causing downtime for customer heavy projects.\r\nEveryone likes less bits of code whether it's SQL, code etc.\r\nWhat problems does it solved:-\r\nBeautiful is better than ugly. YAML really looks more niche than SQL.\r\nFlags used saved us lot of time and execution if already pipe exits when it Create or if Update only run necessary SQL and Delete for housekeeping \r\nThe happiest of them all where the people whole were devops, they love yaml more than anything.\r\nNo outage if no changes made to the snowpipe artifacts.\r\n",

Together with the dbt community, we’ve worked on an adapter that allows you to transform your streaming data in real-time using Materialize as your data warehouse. What does this mean in practice? The first time you run a dbt model on top of Materialize…well, you never have to run it again! No matter how much or how frequently your data arrives, your model will stay up to date. No matter when you query your view, it will always return a fresh answer. Excited? Skeptical? Cautiously optimistic? Join us to see it for yourself as we walk you through a demo!",

These could vary from databases (Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, etc) to product applications (Salesforce, Marketo, HubSpot, etc). A significant number of use-cases need data from these diverse data sources to produce meaningful reports and predictions. \r\nFor many years, organisations tried to centrally collect all their data in the data warehouse but these were not suited or were too expensive for handling unstructured data, semi-structured data, and data with high variety, velocity, and volume. It also limited the types of analytics data teams could use; unable to do machine learning or anything more than basic SQL.\r\n\r\nDelta Lake, released and open-sourced in 2019, is helping thousands of organisations build central data repositories in an open format much more reliably and efficiently than before. Delta Lake provides ACID transactions and efficient indexing that is critical for exposing the data for various access patterns, ranging from ad-hoc SQL queries in BI tools, to scheduled ML jobs. \r\nThis session will provide the one-two step of Data Ingestion & Quality made easy with DELTA Live Tables.\r\n",

            "description": "Proximity Targeting is a marketing technique that uses mobile location services to reach consumers in real-time when they are around a store location or point of interest. This is done by defining a radius around a specific location. If a consumer has opted into location services on their mobile phone and enters within this radius, proximity targeting helps in triggering an advertisement or message to consumers in an effort to influence their behaviour. This can be combined with the ability to purchase impressions through programmatic ad platforms that are powered by real-time bidding which can help businesses formulate the right strategy of influencing their users on a particular geographical area. They can build user groups based on certain characteristics (such as neighbourhoods, demographics, interests, and other data), and subsequently launch another campaign that targets anyone with those characteristics.\r\nThe growth of mobile devices has led to enormous data generation which offers tremendous potential when used effectively for business. Thus we need an efficient platform where we can process such huge data efficiently and with minimum latency and cost. This talk describes MIQ's journey into building a fast, scalable & cost effective processing platform using Spar, MLLib, Kafka's Event Driven microservices, Delta Lakehouse architecture, delivering faster and actionable insights for Proximity targeting which has empowered the creation of a product generating ~30 million dollar revenue on a year to year basis.",

Navigation across such a wide range of technologies and answering simple question: “When to choose what data technology?” suddenly became quite a complex task even for experts.  Andrei, Elizabeth and Eleni joined hands in creating universal and easy to consume bird-eye view of the entire Azure data services. This decision tree helps customers/partners to define and shape their thought process around selection of the certain data technologies and using them together in building data solutions.",

              "description": "Proximity Targeting is a marketing technique that uses mobile location services to reach consumers in real-time when they are around a store location or point of interest. This is done by defining a radius around a specific location. If a consumer has opted into location services on their mobile phone and enters within this radius, proximity targeting helps in triggering an advertisement or message to consumers in an effort to influence their behaviour. This can be combined with the ability to purchase impressions through programmatic ad platforms that are powered by real-time bidding which can help businesses formulate the right strategy of influencing their users on a particular geographical area. They can build user groups based on certain characteristics (such as neighbourhoods, demographics, interests, and other data), and subsequently launch another campaign that targets anyone with those characteristics.\r\nThe growth of mobile devices has led to enormous data generation which offers tremendous potential when used effectively for business. Thus we need an efficient platform where we can process such huge data efficiently and with minimum latency and cost. This talk describes MIQ's journey into building a fast, scalable & cost effective processing platform using Spar, MLLib, Kafka's Event Driven microservices, Delta Lakehouse architecture, delivering faster and actionable insights for Proximity targeting which has empowered the creation of a product generating ~30 million dollar revenue on a year to year basis.",
